
In Java, a final class is a class that cannot be subclassed. 
This means that no other class can inherit from a final class.

There are two reasons why you might want to use a final class:

To prevent subclassing: 
If you want to prevent other classes from inheriting from your class, 
you can make your class final. This can be useful if you want to ensure that the behavior of 
your class is not changed by other classes.

To improve performance: 
Final classes can sometimes improve performance because the Java 
compiler can optimize the code for final classes.
