
Abstraction is one of the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). 
It is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the user. 
This allows the user to focus on the behavior of the object, without having to worry about how the 
object is implemented.

There are many advantages to abstraction in Java, including:

* **Increased code readability and maintainability:** Abstraction makes code easier to 
read and understand because the user does not need to know about the implementation details
 of the object. This can make code more maintainable because changes to the implementation 
 of the object do not need to be reflected in the code that uses the object.
 
* **Improved code security:** Abstraction can help to improve security by hiding sensitive 
data from unauthorized users. This is because the data cannot be accessed directly, and can 
only be accessed through the methods of the class.

* **Reusability of code:** Abstraction can help to improve code reuse by allowing objects to be 
defined in a way that is independent of their implementation. This means that objects can be reused
 in different contexts without having to change the code that uses the objects.
