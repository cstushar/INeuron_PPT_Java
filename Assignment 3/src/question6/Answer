
Encapsulation is one of the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP).
It is the process of binding data and corresponding methods (behavior) together into a single unit. 
This allows for data to be hidden from the outside world, and only accessible through the methods of the class.

There are many benefits to encapsulation in Java, including:

* **Data hiding:** 
Encapsulation allows for data to be hidden from the outside world. 
This means that the data cannot be accessed directly, and can only be accessed through the methods of the class.
This helps to protect the data from being modified or accessed by unauthorized users.

* **Data abstraction:** 
Encapsulation allows for data to be abstracted from the user. 
This means that the user does not need to know how the data is stored or implemented. 
The user only needs to know about the methods that are available to access the data. 
This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

* **Increased flexibility:** 
Encapsulation can make code more flexible by allowing the data to be changed without 
affecting the code that uses it. This is because the code only interacts with the methods of the class, 
and not with the data itself.

* **Improved security:** 
Encapsulation can help to improve security by hiding sensitive data from unauthorized users. 
This is because the data cannot be accessed directly, and can only be accessed through the methods of the class.
