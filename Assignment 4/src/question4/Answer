An interface in Java is a reference type that is used to define a set of methods that must be implemented 
by a class. An interface cannot be instantiated, but it can be used to create references to objects that 
implement the interface.

Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in Java. Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation
 details of an object from the user. This allows the user to focus on the behavior of the object, without 
 having to worry about how the object is implemented.

Interfaces are also used to achieve polymorphism in Java. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take
 on different forms. This can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding.
