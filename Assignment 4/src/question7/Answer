Yes, you can pass lambda expressions to a method. This is called **method reference**.
Method references are a way to pass the functionality of a method to another method.

Here is an example of how to pass a lambda expression to a method:

```java
public class MethodReferenceExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a lambda expression that takes a string as input and prints the string to the console.
    StringPrinter stringPrinter = (str) -> System.out.println(str);

    // Pass the lambda expression to the printString method.
    printString(stringPrinter);
  }

  public static void printString(StringPrinter printer) {
    printer.print("Hello, world!");
  }
}

interface StringPrinter {
  void print(String str);
}
```
In this example, the printString() method takes a StringPrinter interface as input. 
The StringPrinter interface has a single method, print(). The print() method takes 
a string as input and prints the string to the console.

The main() method creates a lambda expression that takes a string as input and 
prints the string to the console. The lambda expression is passed to the printString()
 method. The printString() method calls the print() method on the lambda expression, 
 which prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console.
