
Interfaces in Java are used to achieve abstraction and polymorphism. Abstraction is the process of hiding 
the implementation details of an object from the user. This allows the user to focus on the behavior of the
 object, without having to worry about how the object is implemented. Polymorphism is the ability of an 
 object to take on different forms. This can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding.

Here are some of the uses of interfaces in Java:

* **To define a common behavior for different types of objects:** Interfaces can be used to define a common
 behavior for different types of objects. This allows objects of different types to be used in a consistent
  way. For example, the `Comparable` interface defines a common behavior for objects that can be compared 
  to each other.
  
* **To achieve polymorphism:** Interfaces can be used to achieve polymorphism. This is because interfaces 
can be implemented by different classes, and each class can implement the interface in a different way. 
For example, the `Runnable` interface can be implemented by different classes, such as `Thread` and `Timer`.

* **To improve code readability and maintainability:** Interfaces can improve code readability and 
maintainability by hiding the implementation details of an object from the user. This makes code easier 
to understand and change.

* **To improve code security:** Interfaces can improve code security by hiding sensitive data from 
unauthorized users. This is because the data cannot be accessed directly, and can only be accessed through
 the methods of the interface.

* **To achieve loose coupling:** Interfaces can be used to achieve loose coupling between different parts
 of a program. This means that the different parts of the program can be changed independently of each other,
  as long as they implement the same interface.
