
A lambda expression is an anonymous function that can be used to implement the behavior of an interface.

Here are some of the benefits of using lambda expressions in Java:

* **Conciseness:** Lambda expressions are a concise way to write code that would otherwise be written
 using anonymous inner classes.
* **Readability:** Lambda expressions can make code more readable by making the code easier to understand.
* **Maintainability:** Lambda expressions can make code more maintainable by making the code easier to change.
* **Performance:** Lambda expressions can improve the performance of code by reducing the amount of 
code that needs to be executed.

However, there are also some limitations to lambda expressions:

- Only interfaces that have only one abstract method can be implemented using lambda expressions.
- Lambda expressions can be difficult to understand for beginners.
- Lambda expressions can be difficult to debug for beginners.
