Garbage collection is a process by which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automatically 
deallocates memory that is no longer being used by an application. This is done to free
 up memory and improve the performance of the application.

In Java, memory is allocated to objects when they are created. When an object is no 
longer needed, it is said to be garbage. The garbage collector is responsible for finding
 and deallocating garbage.

The garbage collector is a built-in feature of the JVM. It runs in the background and 
does not require any user intervention. The garbage collector is very efficient and can 
typically reclaim memory without impacting the performance of the application.
