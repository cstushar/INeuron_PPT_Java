
An exception in Java is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal
flow of the program. Exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as invalid input, division 
by zero, or an attempt to access a nonexistent object.

When an exception occurs, the program will stop executing the current line of code and will jump to a
 special section of code called the exception handler. The exception handler will then attempt to handle
  the exception, which may involve printing an error message, logging the exception, or terminating the program.

There are two main types of exceptions in Java:

Checked exceptions: Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be handled by the programmer. 
If a checked exception is not handled, the program will not compile.
Unchecked exceptions: Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that do not have to be handled by the programmer.
If an unchecked exception is not handled, the program will continue to execute, but the results may be 
unpredictable.
