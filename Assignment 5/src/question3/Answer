
In Java, there are two types of exceptions: **checked** and **unchecked**. 
Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be handled by the programmer. 
If a checked exception is not handled, the program will not compile. 
Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that do not have to be handled by the programmer. 
If an unchecked exception is not handled, the program will continue to execute, 
but the results may be unpredictable.

In general, checked exceptions should be handled by the programmer, 
while unchecked exceptions should not be handled. This is because checked exceptions
 are typically caused by problems with the code that the programmer wrote, while 
 unchecked exceptions are typically caused by problems with the JVM or the underlying operating system.
