
Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to continue running even when an error occurs.
When an error occurs, the program will stop executing the current line of code and will jump to a 
special section of code called the exception handler. The exception handler will then attempt to 
handle the exception, which may involve printing an error message, logging the exception, or terminating
the program.

There are two main types of exception handling in Java:

Try-catch: The try-catch block is the most common way to handle exceptions in Java. The try-catch 
block consists of a try block and a catch block. The try block contains the code that is potentially 
problematic. The catch block contains the code that will be executed if an exception occurs in the try block.
Throw: The throw keyword is used to throw an exception. The throw keyword can be used to throw a 
checked exception or an unchecked exception.
