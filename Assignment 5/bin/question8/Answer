A thread is a lightweight process that can run concurrently with other threads. 
Each thread has its own stack, registers, and program counter.

In Java, threads are implemented using the Thread class. The Thread class 
provides a number of methods for controlling the execution of a thread,
 such as start(), sleep(), and join().
 
 class MyThread extends Thread {

  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Thread thread = new MyThread();
    thread.start();
  }
}
