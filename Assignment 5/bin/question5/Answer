
Multithreading is a programming technique that allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same program.

In Java, multithreading is implemented using **threads**. A thread is a lightweight process that 
can run concurrently with other threads. Each thread has its own stack, registers, and program counter.

To create a thread in Java, you can use the `Thread` class. The `Thread` class provides a number
of methods for controlling the execution of a thread, such as `start()`, `sleep()`, and `join()`.

Here are some of the advantages of multithreading in Java:

* **Improved performance:** Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing 
it to take advantage of multiple CPU cores.

* **Increased responsiveness:** Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by 
allowing it to handle multiple requests concurrently.

* **Reduced blocking:** Multithreading can reduce blocking by allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently.
