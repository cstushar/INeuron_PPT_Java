
There are two ways of implementing threads in Java:

Extending the Thread class: This is the most common way to implement threads in Java. 
To extend the Thread class, you need to create a subclass of the Thread class and override 
the run() method. The run() method is the method that will be executed when the thread starts running.

Implementing the Runnable interface: This is another way to implement threads in Java. 
To implement the Runnable interface, you need to create a class that implements the Runnable
 interface and override the run() method. The run() method is the method that will be executed
 when the thread starts running.
